# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the UI to correctly display MetalHead Underground as a social networking platform, removing all incorrect bands/shows/venues booking content.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove all UI elements, text, and references related to booking bands, shows, venues, concerts, tour dates, event listings, or ticketing
- Update all user-facing text to clearly communicate the app is a social networking platform for 21+ metal/rock/punk fans
- Verify that existing social features (profiles, friend requests, feed, posts, blocking, reporting) are correctly displayed and functional

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a clear social networking app for metalheads to connect and share, with no confusion about band booking or venue management features.
